  "name": "The Decameron",
  "description": "\"The Decameron\" by Giovanni Boccaccio is a 14th-century collection of 100 tales told over ten days by a group of young people sheltering from the Black Death in Florence. The stories, ranging in themes from love and tragedy to wit and wisdom, are shared within a structured framework where each day has a particular theme or no theme at all. The tales are often humorous, satirical, and reflective of the values and social norms of medieval European society. The book ends with the characters returning to a recovering Florence, symbolizing hope and renewal.",
