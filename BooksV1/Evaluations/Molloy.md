In the first part, Molloy, a disabled old man, recounts his bewildering journey to visit his mother, filled with absurdities and confusion. The second part follows Jacques Moran, a detective assigned to find Molloy. His journey parallels Molloy's, and he gradually takes on Molloy's characteristics. Themes include the uncertainty of existence, identity confusion, and the inadequacy of language. The novel offers no clear resolution, emphasizing the existential dilemma.",
