  "name": "Don Quixote of La Mancha",
  "description": "*Don Quixote of La Mancha* follows Alonso Quixano, who, driven mad by reading chivalric romances, becomes the self-proclaimed knight Don Quixote. Along with his squire, Sancho Panza, he embarks on a series of misguided adventures, mistaking everyday objects for fantastical elements. His delusions, encounters with others playing along, and self-awareness within a narrative create a complex and humorous tale that ends with his return to sanity and death. The novel explores themes of idealism, reality, and the human condition.",
