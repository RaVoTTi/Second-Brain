  "name": "Design Patterns in Software Engineering",
  "description": "Design Patterns in software engineering offer reusable solutions to common problems. They are categorized into Creational, Structural, and Behavioral patterns, providing guidelines for flexible and efficient code development. By promoting reusability, maintainability, and adaptability, design patterns enhance software quality. A seminal book on this subject is 'Design Patterns: Elements of Reusable Object-Oriented Software'.",
