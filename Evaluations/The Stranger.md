  "description": "\"The Stranger\" is an existentialist novel by Albert Camus, focusing on the emotionally detached protagonist Meursault. After his mother's death, he becomes involved in a conflict and kills an Arab man. His subsequent trial emphasizes his unconventional attitudes more than the crime itself, and he is sentenced to death. Throughout the novel, existential themes like the absurdity of life and the individual's isolation in the universe are explored.",
